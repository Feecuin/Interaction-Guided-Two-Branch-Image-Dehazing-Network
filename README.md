> **Abstract:** *The goal of image dehazing is restoring the hazy images into a clean one. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer have achieved outstanding performance in local and global feature extraction and are currently the two mainstream frameworks in image dehazing. \textbf{In this paper, we propose a dual-branch image dehazing framework that interactively guides CNN and Transformer.} We reconsider the complementary characteristics of CNN and Transformer by leveraging the differential relationships between global and local features for interactive guidance, thereby capturing local feature positions through global attention maps and allowing the CNN to focus only on feature information at effective positions. The design of the Transformer in a single branch ensures the global information recovery capability of the network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields competitive subjective and objective evaluation performance on public synthetic and real datasets.*
